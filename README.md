  > Welcome to Ackack! An app made with the benefit of its users in mind.

## What is this thing? ##
  > Ackack! is an app that acts as alternative communication, specifically to help non-verbal children.

## Summary ##
  > Ackack! whose name is drawn from from AAC(Augmentative and Alternative Communication) serves as an assistant to non-verbal children and children on the autism spectrum. This tool will continue to grow, but in its current state can help with ordering food. Ultimately Ackack!'s categories will have dozens if not hundreds items in it and multi-language use! In the future it aims to have categories such as: groceries, common restaraunt menus, toys, entertainment, education, clothing, colors, weather, medical communication and many more...

## AACs can be costly and difficult ##
  > Many children with autism deal with the daily challenge of communication. Children that present non-verbal behavior use Alternative and Augmentative Communication devices. Many of these devices are extremely costly, and some are not particularly user friendly.

## Solution ##
  > Ackack! brings ease of communication by a 'click-to-speak' method. For now, users can select the category they would like to speak about, then click the item that correlates to what they want to say.
